<p>Gravitational-wave observatories around the world are searching for continuous waves: persistent signals from sources, such as spinning neutron stars. These searches use sophisticated statistical techniques to look for weak signals in noisy data. In this paper, we demonstrate these techniques using a table-top model gravitational-wave detector: a Michelson interferometer where sound is used as an analog for gravitational waves. Using signal processing techniques from continuous-wave searches, we demonstrate the recovery of tones with constant and wandering frequencies. We also explore the use of the interferometer as a teaching tool for educators in physics and electrical engineering by using it as an “optical microphone” to capture music and speech. A range of filtering techniques used to recover signals from noisy data are detailed in the supplementary material of this article. Here, we present the highlights of our results using a combined notch plus Wiener filter and the statistical log minimum mean-square error (logMMSE) estimator. Using these techniques, we easily recover recordings of simple chords and drums, but complex music and speech are more challenging. This demonstration can be used by educators in undergraduate laboratories and can be adapted for communicating gravitational-wave and signal-processing topics to nonspecialist audiences.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>In 2015, the first detection of gravitational waves from the merger of two black holes marked a breakthrough in modern astrophysics and revealed a new means to observe the Universe.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1"><sup>1</sup></xref> Gravitational waves are a prediction of Albert Einstein's theory of General Relativity; they are disturbances in spacetime caused by the acceleration of asymmetric massive objects. The effect of gravitational waves is a change in lengths: a “stretching and squashing” of the distance between objects. Ground-based gravitational-wave observatories, such as the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), Advanced Virgo, GEO600, and KAGRA, use the interference of laser light to measure changes in distance. These observatories are extremely complex but are fundamentally based on the Michelson interferometer. Table-top interferometers are commonly used in undergraduate laboratory experiments and to demonstrate the science of gravitational-wave detection to nonspecialist audiences.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
<p>To date, the network of gravitational-wave observatories has observed short-duration transient signals from the mergers of binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and binaries consisting of a neutron star and a black hole.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3 c4"><sup>3,4</sup></xref> However, the network is also searching for continuous gravitational waves: persistent, periodic, near-monochromatic signals, which are yet to be detected. Rotating neutron stars are prime candidates for continuous-wave emission, especially those in low mass x-ray binaries (LMXB), where the neutron star is in orbit with a low mass stellar companion. The rotation frequency of the neutron star in an LMXB can wander over time due to variable accretion of matter (and hence angular momentum transfer) from the stellar companion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5"><sup>5</sup></xref> Scorpius X-1 is a prime LMXB target for continuous-wave searches. Numerous searches, as yet unsuccessful, have been performed for Scorpius X-1 and other LMXBs (e.g., Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>).</p>
<p>In this paper, we use a table-top Michelson interferometer as a toy gravitational-wave detector designed to detect sound instead of gravitational waves. We then extend its use to an “optical microphone,” using light to capture sound, and present a range of example analysis techniques for educators to use. As an undergraduate lab experiment, the apparatus can be used to teach topics ranging from continuous-wave detection and analysis to electronics, signal processing, and speech enhancement. It allows students in courses, such as physics and electrical engineering, to explore the response of an accessible, yet nontrivial, optomechanical system using a hierarchy of data analysis techniques of increasing complexity, including those used in the search for continuous waves in LIGO and Virgo data.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6 c7"><sup>6,7</sup></xref> This demonstration also has the potential to be used as an outreach tool alongside a range of other public engagement demonstrations and activities developed by gravitational-wave research groups around the world. These tools allow scientists to cater to the increased public and media interest in this field and explain gravitational-wave science to nonspecialist audiences.</p>
<p>This paper is laid out as follows. In Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">II</xref>, we detail the table-top interferometer design. In Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">III</xref>, we demonstrate observing a single tone from a speaker. In Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">IV</xref>, we observe a wandering frequency signal and analyze it using a hidden Markov model technique (the Viterbi algorithm) from continuous-wave searches. In Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">V</xref>, we demonstrate capture and playback of complex audio, such as music and speech. This demonstration of an optical microphone serves as a more general exhibition of signal processing with a range of examples that can be used in the undergraduate laboratory (described in the supplementary material<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26"><sup>26</sup></xref>). We suggest avenues of future work in Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6">VI</xref> and draw conclusions in Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s7">VII</xref>. Further reading and resources are provided in the supplementary material,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26"><sup>26</sup></xref> and we present the software and scripts used to produce this work in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix A</xref>.</p>

<title>TABLE-TOP GRAVITATIONAL-WAVE SCIENCE</title>
<p>Gravitational-wave detectors, such as LIGO and Virgo, are large, complex experiments. However, their design is fundamentally based on the Michelson interferometer, an optical configuration commonly used in undergraduate laboratories. In a Michelson interferometer, laser light is split by a beamsplitter into two perpendicular arms, shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">1</xref>. Mirrors at the end of each arm reflect the two beams back to the beamsplitter where they recombine to produce an interference pattern. The resulting interference pattern is dependent on the relative distance traveled by the beams. Current generation gravitational-wave observatories have kilometer-scale arms (with arm lengths 4 and <inline-formula>

<p>Sound is a commonly used analogy when explaining gravitational-wave science. Gravitational-wave signals from binary black hole and neutron star mergers can be converted to audio signals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8"><sup>8</sup></xref> to aid in explanations. Detection and analysis techniques used by the gravitational-wave community can be demonstrated using table-top equipment (see Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref> as well as the further reading section in the supplementary material<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26"><sup>26</sup></xref> for a selection of other table-top Michelson interferometer designs used for science outreach). Sound vibrations provide a simple means to move the components of a demonstration interferometer, changing the length of the interferometer arms, and thereby altering the interference pattern. We use audio signals throughout this work to simulate gravitational wave-like signals.</p>

</fig>
<p>The motion of the interference fringes follows the motion of M2 and therefore of the speaker. The amplitude of these motions is given by a transfer function that accounts for the coupling and resonance of the speaker-mirror system. If the relative change in the length of the arms is kept small enough, the intensity of the interference pattern at any point on the screen oscillates at the same frequency as the injected audio. For larger relative length changes, multiple fringes pass through the detection point during a single speaker oscillation, raising the measured frequency artificially. Hence, any motion of the fringes must be kept small by playing the sound softly through the speaker. Even without over-counting, large fringe motions display a nonlinear relation between the intensity fluctuations and injected audio, leading to troublesome—but physically interesting—phenomena like frequency doubling.</p>

<title>CONSTANT FREQUENCY SIGNAL</title>
<p>Continuous gravitational-wave searches look for nearly monochromatic signals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9"><sup>9</sup></xref> In this section, we consider the detection of a sinusoidal tone at a single, constant frequency by the table-top interferometer.</p>

<title>WANDERING FREQUENCY SIGNAL</title>
<p>A continuous gravitational-wave signal may wander slowly (and randomly) in frequency over time, due to stochastic internal processes in the superfluid interior of isolated neutron stars, or variable accretion from a stellar companion for neutron stars in binaries, such as LMXBs (see Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref> and references therein). Although continuous gravitational waves are nearly monochromatic, the long observing times (<inline-formula>

<mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> wave cycles, and a coherent search must track the phase to better than half a cycle over the full observation. Here, we consider the audio analog of a tone that wanders in frequency.</p>
<p>A Fourier transform applied to the whole dataset (as in Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">III</xref>) is not well suited to the wandering frequency case as the signal is spread across multiple frequency bins. In continuous-wave searches, the wandering frequency problem is solved using the Viterbi algorithm,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10"><sup>10</sup></xref> which can track the signal's frequency over time. The analysis described in this section is directly inspired by real continuous-wave search methods,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7"><sup>7</sup></xref> yet is pitched at a level appropriate for an undergraduate laboratory setting. In Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4A">IV A</xref>, we briefly review the analysis method used by LIGO and Virgo; in Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4B">IV B</xref>, we describe the methods used in this work; and in Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4C">IV C</xref>, we show the results for recovering a wandering frequency signal using the table-top interferometer.</p><sec id="s4A">
<label>A.</label>
<title>Continuous-wave analysis with real data</title>
<p>The methods used here are inspired by LIGO and Virgo continuous-wave searches. For further details on these methods and continuous-wave searches, we refer the reader to the references in the supplementary material.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26"><sup>26</sup></xref></p>
<p>Continuous-wave searches are performed on long datasets, months to years in duration. The frequency of the signal can wander significantly over the observation period. In this context, “significantly” means across multiple frequency bins, where the typical width of a frequency bin is the reciprocal of the total observation time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6 c9"><sup>6,9</sup></xref></p>
<p>A “hidden Markov model” can be used to search for continuous gravitational waves.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7"><sup>7</sup></xref> In a Markov process, the current state depends only on the previous state. (In this case the “state” is the frequency of the signal.) In a hidden Markov model, the state of the signal is unknown (hidden) and can undergo transitions at discrete times. The transitions are Markovian in that the hidden state (i.e., frequency) of the system at any time depends solely on its state at the previous time.</p>
<p>A detection statistic relates the observed data to the hidden state and quantifies the likelihood of a signal being present in the data at each frequency and time bin. This likelihood is also called the emission probability in gravitational-wave literature. In gravitational-wave data analysis, the detection statistic gives the likelihood of a signal given the antenna beam pattern of the detector, which varies as the Earth rotates and orbits the Sun.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9"><sup>9</sup></xref> When searching for continuous waves from a neutron star in a binary (such as an LMXB), the Doppler modulation of the source also needs to be taken into account and a different detection statistic is used.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7"><sup>7</sup></xref></p>
<p>In continuous-wave searches, a physical model of the target informs how far the frequency of the signal can wander over time. This is called the transition probability matrix. For example, in LMXB searches, the transition matrix allows the signal frequency to (i) stay in the same frequency bin, (ii) move up a single frequency bin, or (iii) move down a frequency bin in each time step.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6"><sup>6</sup></xref> In supernova remnant searches, the source frequency is expected to decrease over time, therefore the allowable transitions are to (i) remain in the same frequency bin, or (ii) move down one frequency bin (see the supplementary material<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26"><sup>26</sup></xref> for LMXB and supernova remnant search references).</p>
<p>The Viterbi algorithm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10"><sup>10</sup></xref> is used to find the most probable sequence of hidden frequency states given the sequence of observables. In Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4B">IV B</xref>, we describe our application of the Viterbi method and our choice of detection statistic.</p>

<p>In continuous gravitational-wave searches, the signal amplitude is expected to be small in comparison with the noise and its frequency can change unpredictably over time. The Viterbi algorithm's strength lies in its ability to track such signals through the data even in the presence of comparatively loud noise fluctuations in the time-frequency bins. In Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4C">IV C</xref>, we present the results of using the Viterbi algorithm with the table-top interferometer data.</p>

<title>Wandering frequency signal results</title>
<p>We simulate a slowly wandering signal by modulating the frequency sinusoidally with a modulation amplitude that decays with time. We use the same apparatus as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">1</xref> and the output interference pattern is recorded via webcam as in Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">III</xref>. In this section, we test the Viterbi algorithm's ability to recover the wandering signal. Note that we implicitly approximate the noise at the webcam as white (uniform in frequency) in this implementation of the Viterbi algorithm. This approximation ignores the increase in noise at low frequencies (below 1 Hz) shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>. However, white noise is a reasonable approximation for the narrow frequency range (around 3–<inline-formula>

<title>COMPLEX AUDIO: MUSIC AND SPEECH</title>
<p>In this section, we explore how our apparatus can be used to teach a selection of signal processing techniques. Complex audio signals, such as music and speech, are natural successors to the constant and wandering tones used in Secs. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">III</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">IV</xref>, respectively. As they are not quasi-monochromatic, the Viterbi algorithm used in Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">IV</xref> is not directly applicable here. Instead, we use a hierarchy of passive filters which suppress noise, yet do not assume any specific form of the signal, unlike the Fourier-based maximum likelihood filter, which is tuned to the sinusoidal signals in Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">III</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2">Appendix B</xref>.</p>
<p>We use the Michelson interferometer as an “optical microphone” to detect sound, replacing the components of a conventional microphone. The only change to our apparatus is replacing the webcam with a photodiode to allow us to capture the higher frequencies necessary for speech and music (see Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5A">V A</xref>). Optical microphones have precedence in the laser microphones<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11"><sup>11</sup></xref> which are (or were historically) used in the defense industry and operate on a variety of related principles. Our objective is to play a recording of speech or music through the speaker attached to mirror M2 (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">1</xref>), record the resulting interference pattern, and then recover the original signal via a selection of signal processing techniques.</p>
<p>The apparatus serves as an independent demonstration for a broader physics and engineering audience, particularly in undergraduate laboratories. We describe additional hardware components required for this demonstration in Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5A">V A</xref> and the initial results in Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5B">V B</xref>. We consider a selection of filter techniques, details of which, along with a summary of digital signal processing resources, can be found in the supplementary material.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26"><sup>26</sup></xref> In Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5C">V C</xref>, we present the two best-performing techniques from the supplementary material.</p><sec id="s5A">

<title>Anti-aliased output</title>
<p>We test the optical microphone with a variety of recordings, including the speech of different people and music ranging from simple melodies and rhythms to songs. During recordings, care is taken to minimize activity around the demonstration to reduce environmental noise coupling into the interferometer. The timeseries data are then directly converted to a Waveform Audio (.wav) file and played as an audio recording using the scipy.io.wavfile.write function in Python (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix A</xref>).

<p>The raw output of the optical microphone (with anti-aliasing) is noisy with a loud, continuous bass hum.

<p>In signal processing, the ideal filter would be one that (i) completely attenuates the undesired parts of the spectrum, (ii) does not change the rest of the spectrum, and (iii) smoothly transitions between these regions, as to not damage the time domain signal when seen under convolution. However, these three requirements cannot all be satisfied at once. For example, if (i) and (ii) hold, then the filter must be discontinuous at the boundary of the undesired region, but this implies that the filter has “infinite latency” and so will affect (or damage) the time domain signal for infinite time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13"><sup>13</sup></xref> For speech intelligibility, this means that either (i) some noise remains in the filtered recording, (ii) some of the speech content is lost as certain important frequencies are attenuated, or (iii) the speech is somewhat distorted in time. Any one of these conditions can, when taken to the extreme, make speech intelligibility worse than in the unfiltered recording. Therefore, we choose filters that provide an effective compromise among the three conditions.</p>
<p>In this section, we present the results of two advanced signal processing techniques applied to the optical microphone recordings. The techniques are only briefly described here, and we refer the reader to the supplementary material<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26"><sup>26</sup></xref> for further details and other analysis techniques.</p>
<p>First, we consider two signal processing techniques used in combination: the cascaded notch and the Wiener filter (see also the supplementary material<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26"><sup>26</sup></xref>). A notch filter removes signals within a specific frequency range. We want to remove the <inline-formula>
<mml:math display="inline" overflow="scroll">
<mml:mrow>
<mml:mn>50</mml:mn>
<mml:mo> </mml:mo>
<mml:mtext>Hz</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> mains noise and its harmonics; therefore we use a cascaded notch filter where each notch is centered on one of the harmonics. The Wiener filter is an advanced statistical technique that makes use of statistical information from the speech data and noise. It amplifies parts of the signal with a high signal-to-noise ratio while suppressing parts with a low signal-to-noise ratio. The results of the combined cascaded notch and Wiener filter are shown in the third row in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">7</xref>. Most of the mains noise is removed; however, the recovered voice sounds muffled and is not understandable.</p>
<p>Next, we apply a speech enhancement technique. Reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref> compares 13 speech enhancement methods, finding the log minimum mean-square error (logMMSE) estimator to be the best, qualitatively, at recovering speech (see also the supplementary material<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26"><sup>26</sup></xref>). We use an existing implementation of the logMMSE from Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>. The results are shown in the bottom panels in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">7</xref>. We see significant attenuation of the mains harmonics and general smoothing of the spectrum. Most of the background noise is removed; however, the logMMSE still does not significantly enhance the speech intelligibility as the voice sounds muffled and indistinct.</p>
<p>We find some improvement with music over speech. Simple chords and drums can be heard after filtering, but more composite sounds and complex melodies cannot be heard clearly. Our observations suggest that this is especially true for certain instruments; in particular, flutes and violins sometimes cannot be heard at all. This could be a perceptual effect or a frequency dependence somewhere in the optical microphone. Speculating, perhaps the speaker-mirror coupling is stronger at low frequencies and thus instruments like electric bass and drums sound louder in the results. To address these problems, we need to determine whether the signals that are audibly missing (the diction in the speech and complex melodies in music) are indeed being transmitted through the optical microphone. To determine this requires a better understanding of the system, as discussed in Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s6">VI</xref>.</p>

<title>FUTURE WORK</title>
<p>The experiment described here can be used to demonstrate and teach a variety of topics, from basic optics and photodiode circuits to signal processing and speech enhancement. Cross-disciplinary undergraduate laboratory experiments between physics and engineering courses are beneficial to student learning (see Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">II</xref> in the supplementary material<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26"><sup>26</sup></xref> for further information). Here, we consider further extensions and improvements to the experiment, such as noise isolation, transfer function analysis, speech recognition, and control systems.</p>
<p>Isolating the experiment from interference may provide some noise reduction. The Raspberry Pi could be powered with a commercial battery instead of mains power, which may help to isolate the circuit from the mains as all other components draw power from the Raspberry Pi (the laser is DC-powered through a converter). Transferring the circuit from a breadboard to a printed circuit board can also reduce interference.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16"><sup>16</sup></xref> A feedback loop control system can also be used to suppress any unwanted movement of the interferometer components,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17 c18 c19"><sup>17–19</sup></xref> similar to the methods used to isolate gravitational-wave observatories.</p>
<p>A thorough characterization of the system's transfer function would allow us to understand how audio signals couple through the interferometer. The total transfer function starts with the voltage being sent to the speaker and ends with the voltage recorded by the Raspberry Pi. It would include any inherent nonlinearities in the speaker, the speaker-mirror coupling, the path length to intensity relation, and the photodiode. The schematic in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">8</xref> shows the abstract signal flow through the system. It does not include other potential pathways for signal flow, such as acoustomechanical vibrations of the webcam or photodiode mount, which could also be examined.</p>

<p>A voluminous literature exists on using hidden Markov models trained on phonemes to recognize speech.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20"><sup>20</sup></xref> These could perform the final stage of speech enhancement for the optical microphone. This coincidentally connects back to the Viterbi algorithm in Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">IV</xref>, which is also underpinned by a hidden Markov model, albeit of a different type. Alternatively, machine learning solutions exist throughout the field that can provide results competitive with statistical techniques (such as the logMMSE estimator used here).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21"><sup>21</sup></xref></p>
<p>More traditional techniques, such as a wavelet transform,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22"><sup>22</sup></xref> could be used to extract the signal from noise and compared with the above methods. A wavelet transform provides both time and frequency information, making it easier to pinpoint the origin of noise with respect to time. In Refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref> wavelet transform methods are proposed for speech recognition.</p>
<p>Returning to the demonstration of gravitational wave analysis, single interferometers cannot yield directional information for signals; a large proportion of the directional information in gravitational-wave detections comes from the time delay offset between the observation being recorded at two or more detectors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1"><sup>1</sup></xref> We could, therefore, extend this analysis to include data from two interferometers to extract directional information. This would require increasing the sensitivity of the optical microphone to pick up the signal from a distant source instead of from a speaker attached directly to one of the mirrors of the interferometer. Another extension would be to demonstrate the Doppler effect of the Earth's motion around the Sun, which needs to be considered in continuous-wave searches (see Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4A">IV A</xref> and Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). One approach could be to modify the input audio signal to simulate Doppler modulation.</p>

<title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>In this paper, we use a table-top Michelson interferometer as an analog to a gravitational-wave detector, demonstrating signal processing techniques used within the gravitational-wave community. We explore the use of the interferometer as an optical microphone and consider a more general treatment of signal processing with complex audio signals, which can also serve as a distant analog to minimally modelled gravitational-wave burst signals, e.g., from supernovae. The demonstration can be adapted for use in both the physics and engineering undergraduate laboratory, providing opportunities for cross-disciplinary teaching. Additionally, it can be used as a tool for explaining gravitational-wave research to a wider, nonspecialist audience.</p>
<p>As the field of gravitational-wave astrophysics continues to grow, the future will bring many more detections of binary black holes and neutron stars, as well as the anticipated first detection of other classes of signals, such as continuous waves, to which this demonstration provides some charming insights.</p>

<title>APPENDIX C: VITERBI ALGORITHM</title>
<p>This appendix contains some details rearding the implementation of the Viterbi algorithm described in Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4B">IV B</xref>. The Viterbi algorithm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10"><sup>10</sup></xref> is a classic method in signal processing, whose theoretical underpinnings and implementation are accessible to undergraduate students. See the supplementary material<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26"><sup>26</sup></xref> for further resources and other pseudocode examples available online.</p>
<p>Here, we present some pseudocode (below) of the implementation used in Sec. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4B">IV B</xref>. We use Fourier amplitudes, normalized between (0, 1) by dividing by the maximum value in the grid, as multiplicative weights. To avoid numerical underflow, we take the logarithm of the Fourier amplitudes, which we can equivalently use as additive weights.</p>
